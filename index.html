								<p>Despite progress in public health measures and vaccination efforts, COVID-
19 remains a formidable challenge to global health due to the mutable nature of the
virus[1], the observed waning immunity post-vaccination and subsequent to natural
infections[2,3], and a risk profile markedly graver than that of influenza[4].
To mitigate healthcare system burdens and prevent long COVID, early antiviral treatment of mild cases is essential.
The overlapping impact of COVID-19, long COVID, and influenza, especially in winters, underscores the urgency for a universal treatment approach.
We hypothesize that treating multifaceted COVID infections—much like solving a Rubik’s Cube, which—
despite trillions of combinations—has only three rotating layers on each axis (X, Y, Z)—
requires a focus on three aspects: immune system strength, symptom alleviation, and
viral load reduction. To this end, we propose precision medicine that tailors dosages
based on individual characteristics such as age, pre-existing health conditions, and
symptom severity to optimize personalized treatment plans. This method aims to
improve antiviral efficacy and reduce adverse side effects. We also envision an
autonomous machine learning platform, ACT-ML, informed by Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM) principles, to offer scalable, personalized antiviral treatment in
outpatient settings. This platform is designed to convert clinical triage into a
classification task in machine learning.</p>

								<p>Our approach involved the development of ACT-ML, leveraging 340 million
synthetic patient records, which focused on 44 symptoms across three age groups: 14-
40, 41-60, and 60 and above. The validation included a 49-patient retrospective
simulation study and a clinical feasibility trial among 27 patients (13 with mild and
moderate COVID-19 cases, one severe outpatient COVID-19 case, one severe COVID-19
intensive care unit patient, 10 long COVID cases, and two influenza cases) from June to
August 2023.</p>
